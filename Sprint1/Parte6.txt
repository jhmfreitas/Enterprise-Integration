We decided to make a failure test for our Maas Operator using the T1_Uber topic.

We started by checking that all the 3 brokers were well configured and who were the liders of the partitions of this topic:

Then we created a producer with the command: 

java -jar MaaSMessageTaxiGenerator.jar --broker-list <Public_DNS>:9093,<Public_DNS>:9094,<Public_DNS>:9095 --topic T1_Uber --token-list jkdjdjs --throughput 2000 --typeMessage JSON

(We decided to use a big value for the throughput to test if our Maas Operator could handle a big load)


Then we created a consumer with the command: 

/usr/local/kafka/bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server <Public_DNS>:9093,<Public_DNS>:9094,<Public_DNS>:9095 --topic T1_Uber --group g1


After some time we ran this command to check the PID of the brokers:
ps -ef |grep java |grep server


Then we stopped broker 2:

sudo kill <Broker_2_PID>

and checked the change in the leaders:

The consumer continued to receive the messages


After some time we stopped broker 3:

sudo kill <Broker_3_PID>

and checked the change in the leaders:
